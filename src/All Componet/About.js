            Bright Future Academy Charitable Trust was formed with an aim to provide an opportunity to the people of
            this district to help their childeren in get education in English Medium Academy of this to get affiliation
            from H.B.S.E.
            Haryana. It was also realised by the Trust that the rural people of the Sirsa District had no facilities to
            give such education to their children. So it was a pressing need for an English Medium Co-Educational
            Academy.

            Thus the whole responsibility of raising such an institution was boldly taken up by its founder Director
            Pradeep Pareek with very little budget.

            This academy was founded in Feb. 2019 in a rented building and has travelled to the status of the present
            day with its own purpose-built building with proper facilities for studies, sports and hobbies and all round
            development of pupil.

            The foundation stone of this building was laid down by its founder, the then Principal Pradeep Pareek. His
            sincere efforts and dedication made it the first academy of this to get affiliation from H.B.S.E. , Haryana.
